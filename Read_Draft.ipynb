    "# CPPND: Capstone Autonomous Snake Game \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this repo is based on [Udacity Capstone Snake Game Example](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, player controls one snake agaist one self-navigated snake, whose action is base on a path searching algorithm. Expansion method is the core for constructing the path.\n",

    "In this project, player controls one snake agaist one self-navigated snake, whose action is base on a real time path searching. Expansion method is used for constructing the path.  \n",

    "## Code Structure\n",
    "<img src=\"structure.JPG\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubic Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.  \n",
    "2. The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.  \n",
    "3. Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.  \n",
    "  * members are specified as public and protected in class snake (snake.h)\n",
    "  * members are specified as public and private in class snake (auto_snake.h)\n",
    "4. Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.  \n",
    "  * game.cpp - line 7\n",
    "  * snake.h - line 12\n",
    "  * auto_snake.h - line 16  \n",
    "5. Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.  \n",
    "6. Classes encapsulate behavior.  \n",
    "7. Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.  \n",
    "  * class auto_snake inheritate from class snake\n",
    "  * composition: game.h - line 26\n",
    "8. Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.  \n",
    "  * virtual function: snake.h - line 42\n",
    "  * override: auto_snake.h - line 21\n",
    "9. The project makes use of references in function declarations.<br>\n",
    "10. The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible.  \n",
    "  * auto_snake.h - line 16\n",
    "11. The project uses multithreading.  \n",
    "  * game.cpp - line 70  \n",
    "12. A mutex or lock is used in the project.  \n",
    "  * unique_lock: snake.cpp - line 37, auto_snake.cpp - line 78, \n",

    "## Dependencies for Running Locally\n",
    "* cmake >= 3.7\n",
    "  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)\n",
    "* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)\n",
    "  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros\n",
    "  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)\n",
    "  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)\n",
    "* SDL2 >= 2.0\n",
    "  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)\n",
    "  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.\n",
    "* gcc/g++ >= 5.4\n",
    "  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros\n",
    "  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)\n",
    "  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Build Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repo.\n",
    "2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
    "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`\n",
    "4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`."
